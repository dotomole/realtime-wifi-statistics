# Realtime Wi-Fi Statistics (Windows)

This program allows you to view wi-fi statistics in realtime. Something I just made for myself really, useful for walking around your home/workplace and seeing where the signal is best.

Usage: `py wifi.py`<br/>

Current version shows:
- SSID
- Wi-Fi Signal Strength
- Ping to router (default gateway)
- Router Wi-Fi Speed (Not Internet Speed)
